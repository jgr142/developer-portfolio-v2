I was born and raised in Switzerland in a Mexican family, and moved to New York City at age 11 without knowing a word of English. <br><br> I'm now pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a Data Science minor at Rice University, and could not have been more grateful for every moment that has brought me to this point in my life. <br><br> I am deeply interested in the disruptions AI is causing and in building the systems and models that make AI so powerful and beneficial to humanity. Because with great power comes great responsibility."

I’m especially fascinated by the dramatic shift from the detailed realism and grandeur of historical art between the 1500s and 1800s to the more experimental, abstract, and conceptually driven movements of the 1850s to the mid-20th century. I’ve taken several courses, including ones on Global Modernism, exploring how art and architecture across continents reflect tensions between tradition and modernity, and the Baroque Masters, including Rembrandt, Caravaggio, Velázquez, and others. What draws me in is how visual language evolves to reflect broader cultural and philosophical changes—how meaning can be expressed with as much power in abstraction as in realism.<br><br>Whether it's studying a Rembrandt chiaroscuro or the visual fragmentation of modernist architecture, art history gives me a different lens for thinking about structure, symbolism, and creativity.",
